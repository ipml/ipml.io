An open and distributed database that is not controlled by a profit-oriented
entity. Its openness enables every business to independently set their own
prices.
Such a database could revolutionize retail markets by creating unimagined
synergies between potential buyers and sellers as well as open opportunities
for 3rd parties to provide services ontop of it. Such a database can be built
with blockchain technologies.
