Online retailers are **private corporation** with the aim of making profits
and so they sit on their data about sellers for their own benefit. For the
customer, however, other characteristics are important too.

Unfortunately, customers cannot adequately weight these desires, such as
regionality, sustainability or environmental protection because the
search criteria are specified by the dealer.
