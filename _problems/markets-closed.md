Online retailers are **private corporation** with the aim of making profits
and so they sit on their data about sellers for their own benefit. For the
customer, however, other characteristics are important, too.

Unfortunately, customers cannot adequately weigh these desires, such as
regionality, sustainability or environmental protection because the search
criteria are limited by the dealer.
