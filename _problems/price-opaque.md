Imagine selling your home-made toys online through a dealer. Do you know what
the dealer is asking for your product? Are you sure? Of course not, because
pricing policy is a company secret and as such it happens that prices differ
greatly from region to region to maximize profits - in some cases with the risk
that your toys are not bought. If a potential buyer had known what you as the
manufacturer for the toy wanted, he would probably have come to you right away.
